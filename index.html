    <p id="ptag1">JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
        curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p><br><br>

    <p id="ptag2">As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
        standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any
        input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web
        browser) provides those APIs. </p>
